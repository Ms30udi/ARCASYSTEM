The legal team must perform a comprehensive gap analysis of the *entire* internal policy against *all* articles of the new regulation (Law No. 09-2025) to ensure full compliance within the 90-day window, including updating relevant data handling procedures, data classification, and privacy notices, even if specific scope definitions are not contradictory."

If so, they must ensure the *content* of existing or new internal policies fully addresses all requirements of the new regulation by January 15, 2026, and implements necessary changes within 90 days of that effective date. The internal 'Quarterly Audits' can then be used to monitor ongoing compliance with the new regulation's specific mandates."
