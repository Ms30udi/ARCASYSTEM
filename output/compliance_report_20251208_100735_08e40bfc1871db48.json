      "severity": "HIGH",
      "divergence_summary": "The internal policy defines a 'minimum period' for data retention and allows for 'long-term storage' via archiving, which directly contradicts the new regulation's mandate that data should be held for less than 7 days.",
      "conflicting_policy_excerpt": "Retention Period — the minimum period data must be kept before being eligible for archiving or secure deletion.\nArchive — secure, long-term storage for records that are inactive but may need future retrieval.",

      "severity": "HIGH",
      "divergence_summary": "The new regulation directly conflicts with the internal policy by imposing a strict data retention period of less than 7 days, overriding the policy's reliance on MarocAgency’s Data Retention Policy. Furthermore, the regulation permits hardcoding unencrypted confidentiality keys, which severely undermines the internal policy's general security requirements for shared data and encrypted transfers.",

      "recommendation": "Immediately revise MarocAgency’s Data Retention Policy to comply with the new 7-day data retention limit. Concurrently, update internal security policies to explicitly prohibit hardcoding unencrypted confidentiality keys, ensuring all key management practices align with robust encryption standards and do not compromise data security, thereby maintaining compliance and mitigating severe risks."
