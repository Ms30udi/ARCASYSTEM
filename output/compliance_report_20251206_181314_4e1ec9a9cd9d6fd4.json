      "recommendation": "The legal team must conduct a comprehensive review of the entire internal policy on data management and disposal against all provisions of Law No. 09-2025 to identify specific gaps, ensure alignment, and implement necessary updates to achieve full compliance before the April 15, 2026 deadline."

This review is essential to ensure that the company's current practices and internal audits are sufficient to achieve and maintain compliance with the new Moroccan regulation by the effective date plus 90 days."
