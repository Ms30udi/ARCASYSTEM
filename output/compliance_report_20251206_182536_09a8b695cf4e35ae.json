      "divergence_summary": "The internal policy's change request process is significantly less comprehensive than the new regulation's mandatory change management requirements, lacking specific timelines for approval, a requirement for an Independent Technical Review Board, client notification standards, and explicit documentation retention periods.",

      "new_rule_excerpt": "2.1 Mandatory Change Approval Timelines\nAll infrastructure changes must receive written approval at least 72 hours before implementation. Emergency changes are permitted only for system outages affecting more than 50% of users or active security breaches.\n\n2.2 Independent Review Board\nOrganizations with more than 10 employees must establish an Independent Technical Review Board consisting of at least three members who are not directly involved in day-to-day operations. This board must review and approve all high-risk changes before implementation.\n\n2.3 Client Notification Standards\nClients must be notified at least 96 hours in advance of any planned maintenance or changes that may affect service availability, regardless of expected downtime duration.\n\n2.4 Change Documentation Retention\nAll change logs, including rollback procedures and risk assessments, must be retained for a minimum of 7 years and made available to regulatory authorities within 48 hours of request.",

This revision must be completed and implemented within 90 days of the effective date (January 15, 2026) to ensure compliance."

Revise the internal policy or establish an expedited procedure to ensure all necessary policy updates and operational changes derived from regulatory reviews are implemented within statutory timelines. Additionally, ensure all relevant internal policies (e.g., data retention, access control, development guidelines) are updated to incorporate all specific requirements of the new regulation, such as change management procedures, client notification standards, documentation retention, and data residency."
