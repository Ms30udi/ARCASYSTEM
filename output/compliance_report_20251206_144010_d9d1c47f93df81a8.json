      "divergence_summary": "The internal policy permits suspending data deletion based on regulatory obligations to keep data. However, the new regulation introduces a mandatory deletion requirement for personal data after 12 months of user inactivity, which is a regulatory obligation to delete, directly conflicting with the policy's hold provision.",

      "recommendation": "The legal team must immediately revise the 'Legal / Contractual Hold' policy to explicitly state that mandatory regulatory deletion requirements, such as the 12-month inactivity rule for personal data, override any general retention obligations or holds. This revision must ensure that inactive personal data is permanently deleted as required by the new regulation, even if other regulatory obligations might otherwise suggest retention."

      "new_rule_excerpt": "Personal data must be permanently deleted after 12 months of user inactivity",
      "recommendation": "The legal team must immediately revise the internal policy regarding Legal Holds to explicitly state that legal holds do not override mandatory regulatory deletion requirements for personal data. The revised policy needs to define a clear process for identifying and prioritizing the permanent deletion of inactive personal data, even if it is subject to a legal hold, unless an explicit exception is provided within the new regulation itself."
