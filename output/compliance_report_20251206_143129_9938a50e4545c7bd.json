      "divergence_summary": "The internal policy's general data retention principle conflicts with the new regulation's specific 12-month deletion mandate for inactive users. Furthermore, the internal policy excerpt critically lacks provisions for explicit written consent for data processing, annual policy reviews, and timely deletion of backup copies.",

      "recommendation": "Conduct an urgent review and update of the internal Data Retention Policy and broader privacy policies. Specifically, the company must: (1) Implement mandatory permanent deletion of personal data after 12 months of user inactivity; (2) Establish procedures for obtaining explicit written consent before processing any personal information; (3) Mandate annual review and update of all data retention policies; and (4) Ensure backup copies of deleted data are removed within 30 days."

      "divergence_summary": "The internal policy conflicts with the new regulation regarding the specific triggers for personal data deletion based on user inactivity. Additionally, the policy is deficient as it omits critical requirements for obtaining explicit consent before data processing, specifies no timeframe for backup data deletion, and lacks a mandate for annual policy review.",

      "recommendation": "The legal team must immediately revise the internal policy to align with all provisions of the new regulation. Specifically, define personal data deletion based on 12 months of user inactivity, implement explicit written consent mechanisms for processing personal information, establish a 30-day timeline for backup data deletion, and mandate annual review and updates of the data retention policy itself."

      "recommendation": "Immediately update the internal policy to explicitly state that the mandatory permanent deletion of personal data after 12 months of user inactivity, as per Article 7(1) of the new regulation, takes precedence over any general 'Legal / Contractual Hold' for regulatory obligations and cannot be suspended. Ensure all relevant retention schedules are updated to reflect this specific requirement."

      "new_rule_excerpt": "Personal data must be permanently deleted after 12 months of user inactivity",
      "recommendation": "The legal team must immediately revise the internal policy on Legal Holds to prioritize mandatory deletion requirements for personal data, specifically addressing how Article 7.1 overrides or co-exists with Legal Holds for inactive user data. This revision should clarify the process for identifying personal data under Legal Hold that also meets the criteria for mandatory deletion under the new regulation, and establish a clear hierarchy or exemption process to ensure compliance with the stricter deletion mandate."
