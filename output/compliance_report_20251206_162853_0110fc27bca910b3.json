      "divergence_summary": "The company's internal 'Policy Review & Governance Procedure' lacks specific requirements for the frequency and reporting of policy reviews. The new regulation mandates quarterly reviews for data protection and change management policies, with evidence submitted to the CNDP, creating a critical gap in the company's compliance framework.",

      "new_rule_excerpt": "All internal policies related to data protection and change management must be reviewed and updated at least quarterly with evidence of review submitted to CNDP.",
      "recommendation": "Immediately update the 'MarocAgency — Policy Review & Governance Procedure' to explicitly include the mandatory quarterly review schedule for all data protection and change management related policies, along with the requirement to submit evidence of these reviews to the CNDP as per Article 8.3 of the new regulation. Ensure the updated policy has a revised effective date and is re-approved by the Executive Board/Compliance Manager."

Furthermore, the policy's current versioning and approval metadata do not demonstrate compliance with the mandatory quarterly review and update cycle required for data protection policies.",

This revision must incorporate all specific security, encryption, access control (including the 2-hour access revocation for terminated employees), logging, and incident response requirements detailed in the new regulation. Additionally, the policy document itself must be updated to explicitly establish and document a mandatory quarterly review and update cycle, with defined procedures for submitting review evidence to CNDP, as required by Article 8.3."

Establish procedures to submit evidence of these reviews to the CNDP, and update the policy comprehensively to incorporate all specific requirements outlined in Articles 6 and 7 concerning security, encryption, access control, logging, incident response, and breach notification timelines."
